RESTRICTIONS:
	1.if filesytem is named as c during use comand(use osfile as c), it should be referred as c in all other commands(cp c:test 		testfile)
	
	2.mv command only for renaming files in 1 filesystem(as mentioned in the example session)
	
	3.megabytes should be written as "mb" and not "MB"
	
	4.any file copied from OS to a filesystem must be present in the working directory, or the entire path must be mentioned
