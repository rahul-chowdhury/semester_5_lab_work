1.Here process1 is the process which is generating the numbers using the rand function and printing the factorial.
2.And process2 is the process which is generating the factorials.
3.Follow the steps to create executable file for the both processes.
  cc process1.c -o exe1
  cc process2.c -o exe2
In this manner executable files named exe1 and exe2 will be generated.
4.Run the two programs in separate terminals.
